title: hey Google, ask for my informed consent or consider it rejected.

synopsis: informed consent should be the norm not the exception

Last week, the Internet found out that Google has been [quietly tracking nearly all of your online purchases] (https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629789/google-purchase-history-gmail-email-receipts). 

Check this page and be amused or appalled by how much takeout you've ordered since the tracking began. Take that trip down memory lane and be reminded yet again that this behemoth knows far more about you could conceivably imagine.

Every single time an online store sends a confirmation email to your Gmail account, Google adds it to your list of purchases. Google claims that nobody else can view that information - they say it's private but I'm not so sure that that's what privacy means. More importantly, I doubt that consumers knew about this feature or wanted it. 

If I decide to stalk you, and I create a dashboard that shows you the longitude and latitude of every single step you've taken in your life, how would you feel? 

Even if I provided you with a one-time link to this dashboard, and I encrypted the data such that I never personally viewed your positions on the dashboard. 

Would you want that?

"Ah, but you consented to this when you agreed to use Gmail. It's in the Terms of Service" - the naysayers will retort.

Listen, there's a huge difference between drowning a person in pages and pages of Legalese (fondly called a privacy policy agreement) and telling someone in plain English that they will track your spending data.

Google can and should do the latter. 

### When last did anyone read a privacy policy document? 
It's an arduous and painful process for anyone who's not a lawyer. Google knows this. And Google, like everyone else knows that (generally) people prefer to avoid painful experiences when they can choose to do. 

They know that people will often choose the easiest path. Ever wondered why a company would make it super easy to subscribe to to their service but monumentally more difficult to unsubscribe from them? They know people will sign up, because it's easy and they know that some will give up when trying to unsubscribe, because it's difficult. Ultimately, they'll have more paying subscribers. I've always considered this is an atrocious customer experience but its rampant in this internet age. 

Designers often use lots of visual tricks to indicate whether an action on a webpage is important or not - using color contrast, using bold fonts, using notifications to confirm  actions, making important things bigger on the page, placing important things in places where human eyes will naturally gravitate towards. 

So when you put a simple, tiny checkbox on a web page to confirm whether or not I read your 386-page privacy policy document, you are saying a lot. You are telling me that it's not important that I actually read the document. You're conveying the fact that it's not one of the the most important things in that transaction. You're far more interested in me providing you with a working credit card, than whether I read the document.

If I type a poorly formatted email address in a form, your website will yell at me. You'd tell me to provide a functional email address. But if I never even open the privacy policy document, you won't be bothered. If I open it for 3 seconds, you won't be bothered. Even when you know that it's physically impossible to read and digest the consequences of that document in 3 words. 

That says a lot about priorities.  

Lack of informed consent is not just a Google problem

Ever added a new phone number to your address book and then you visit Facebook and you noticed that person is being magically recommended as a potential new friend?
Did you explicitly give Facebook access to your phone book?

I doubt it. 

I wonder how they could've gotten that access without your explicit agreement. It's almost as if Facebook wanted to grow their social connections more than they wanted to ask you for permission to your phone book. 

Funny, how that works. 

Nonetheless, this issue of "informed consent" is not restricted to the tech industry. In November 2018, He Jiankui shocked the world when he announced that the birth of twin girls whose DNA he had edited with CRISPR. Rebelling against global scientific guidelines, he had created the world's first CRISPR babies. 

The scientist who performed this experiment has been roundly and rightly condemned by the scientific community for multiple reasons. His claim that the DNA edits he made would provide the girls with lifelong immunity from HIV infection has been rejected as naive, wrong and scientifically unproven. There's a reason why the scientific community had created a global ban on using CRISPR on human embryos. We simply do not know enough about the long term effects on using this technology on humans. Oh, and because CRISPR is considered germline editing - the DNA edits that were created during his experiment would be passed on to the children of the twin girls. And their children's children. And beyond, to their future generations in perpetuity. 

So a scientist worked in secrecy and imparted unquantifiable risks to a pair of children and their future generations. That's terrible. Moreover, we know that the informed consent process was fundamentally flawed. 

Did the parents really know the full ramifications of the experiment?
How could the twins consent to having their DNA modified when they were unborn? 
Especially, when the perceived benefit (an unproven claim of providing lifelong immunity from HIV infection) is smaller than the risks (we literally do not know what will happen to these children). And given that there are safer ways for dealing with HIV infection in case the children got the virus.
There might be cases in the future where human germline editing might be ethical. But nearly all scientists agree that this was a gross rejection of today's ethical guidelines. Whilst, there is some scientific debate about the best way to proceed with research in this area, I think it's important to acknowledge that this is a question for all of society to answer - not just scientists. Technology is a tool and we should expect that all tools will be misused and abused and we as society need to weigh the benefits with the potential worst outcomes. 
Life is not Zara. You can return your skinny jeans to Zara because they are the wrong size. But you can't return your DNA because you don't like the alterations some exiled scientist put in you when you were an embryo.

### So what should He Jiankiu have done?
He should have followed the guidelines and should not have proceeded with the experiment. Sadly, we can't teleport back in time to stop him from his madness.

### So what should Google do?
Re-evaluate the meaning of privacy and the expectations that users have with regards to their information. In my view, privacy is not just about who can access my information. It's about me understanding what information about me exists. It's also about the fact you're gathering information that I don't want gathered about me. 
"To help you easily view and keep track of your purchases, bookings and subscriptions in one place, we've created a private destination that can only be seen by you".


"You can delete this information at any time. We don't use any information from your Gmail messages to serve you ads, and that includes the email receipts and confirmations shown on the Purchase page.
 Google told the Verge in a statement. 

I anticipate a variety of responses to that statement depending on your perspective towards big tech. 
You might believe that Google is so benevolent that they truly want to make it easy to track all your purchases. You may not see any nefarious intent with this. Or on the more skeptical side, you may blatantly distrust Google and consider this a standard PR lie. Somewhere in the middle, you would see this as Google's first step to making a product like Mint - an automated tool to help you with budgeting and personal finance. I mean Google knows everywhere you go and everywhere you spend money, so why shouldn't they help you spend money more wisely?

Give people the power to emphatically give informed consent
Hey Google, you need to make it clear in simple, lay man's language what information you're gathering about people. 
If people are shocked that you have certain data about them, then that means that you've failed in this area. 



What else are you scraping my emails to look for?If you want to scrape my emails to keep track of my purchases, do not bury that information in a document that you know I won't read. 
You know how to be direct. I mean your home page is literally a white page with a search bar and two buttons. This is how to be direct - this page tells me that you want me to search for stuff. 

*** insert Google home page screenshot***


This is the clearest, most-direct page I've ever seen. Its intent is obvious.If you want my purchase data, why can't you ask me in this manner?
Ask me directly, and tell me why you're doing it. Otherwise, it's up for me to make interpretations on why you could be doing it. And I'm going to consider the possibility that your intentions are not in line with my best intentions. 

If I decide that I want you to have that information, then I would gladly and emphatically give you access. To your credit, I understand that you have made it easy for people to delete this data. But this seems backwards to me. Instead of granting you a green light, you moved forward on a red light and are asking forgiveness while asking me to undo the damage. 

Not a great customer experience.
