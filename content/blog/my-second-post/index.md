Ever heard of a blazing hot chemical engineering startup founded by teenage dropouts?
No?

There's a reason for that. Well, multiple reasons actually.

a) yearzzzzzzz for scientific breakthrough
b) is it clinical? lol, you gotta do trials and studies and hella stuff
c) scale up - ha, for tech, you mostly have to ask AWS to increase your x, y and z. But in hard tech....you need to build actual physical facilities, you need to create transportation networks, supply chains, etc etc. 

a) touch on Theranos (in fact link to the fact that this disrepancy initially caused John Carreyou to be suspiscious of Elizabeth Holmes)

There's a reason why you never hear stories about a hot new chemical engineering startup created by dropouts that's doing the rounds. 

1. It's fascinating and rewarding that so many young people are sufficiently skilled and empowered to build products that (positively) impact many. You don't need much in terms of resources to be a productive dev. 

- well, is that true? can you really compete? FAANG would buy you, or copy you and put 100x the resources (people and money) to duplicate your product. They would buy you or strangle you. Which is ironic considering these companies were themselves startups trying to swim up against the tide - the rentseekers. And now they themsevles are the rentseekers. That said, obviously no company wants to die.

Wow! I love blogging so much already.

Did you know that "despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from
chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the
egg yolk will be less rich."?
([Wikipedia Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg))

Yeah, I didn't either.
