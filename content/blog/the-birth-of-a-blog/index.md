This blog article is not ready yet!!

Unlike a zygote, this blog was birthed from the fusion of three things --

1. My fascination with the relationship between humans and technology - what is it doing to us, and what are we doing with it?
 
2. My perspective - I've had the fortune of working in four technology industries on three continents. I know what technology means in the context of a thirty year old food manufacturing plant. And I know what it means in the context of writing open source software at a company used by 250 million people every month. 

3. My skepticism - I consider myself an optimist with a healthy dose of skepticism. Skeptic in the sense that I question things a lot. From the wacky (hello Gwyneth Paltrow) to the firmly accepted, you can expect me to question the basis and the consequences of these things. 



So here I am - painting words on a blank canvas as I seek to find answers for my questions about technology's influence on us, and our influence on it. 

Welcome to my headspace.

When I speak about technology, I'm referring to all the force multipliers that enable humans to do more. Technology is not just the code that powers the Lyft that takes you home after yet another drunken night (no judging :D), but also the yeast that makes life-saving insulin for diabetics, and the cast iron that so wonderfully conducts heat on the wok that prepared your pad thai dinner. 

That said, today I am a software engineer. And in 2019, software is omnipresent - influencing our modern lives in ways that are sometimes obvious (think apps on your phone) and sometimes unseen (think police predicting crime). So let's use software tech as home base. 

It's nearly impossible today to use the internet without interacting with at least one of the big five tech companies (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Fb, Google). Well, it's not exactly impossible - this journalist tried and seemingly had a terrible experience. It's possible but significantly inconvenient. 

In roughly a decade, we've gone from Steve Jobs presenting us with the first iPhone, to a fantasy world in which smartphone apps have become verbs. Think about that for a second. 
We use "Uber" and "Google" as verbs. That's how insane technology's influence on society has been. These companies have permeated not only our daily lives and our wallets but even our vernacular. We live in a time when people are building apps (Focus, TimeWellSpent) to help humans spend more of their time on life instead of using other apps. 

We live in a time when you have all the power that the ancient kings would've killed for. You can request a stranger becomes your cab driver, and you would probably be frustrated if the stranger took more than four minutes to arrive at your beck and call. You can demand someone comes into your house to set up your TV on your wall. You get to order the most frivolous things that your heart desires, and these will be shipped across the Americas and delivered to your holiness. 

(Spoiler alert) - we've never had the ability to do any of this before. 

Of course, tied to this immense social change has been an incredible amount of wealth generation and market domination by the big five. So much money has been made in Silicon Valley that we have the highest number of billionaires per capita. (And yes, you can assume that most of these people made money via software-related companies)
Technology is reconfiguring society. Let's zoom out and ask a couple questions about the current state of this world.

Here are a few questions that are top of my mind. I'll probably tackle each one of these in a separate article in the future. For now, here are my musings. 

### What does it mean for society when a single company (Facebook) has more users than the global population of Christianity? 
Said company is led by a man who answers to nobody, was never elected to this post and owns so much controlling stock that he is more likely to spontaneously mutate into a Russian potato than cede control of his company. 

Even if the CEO was a perfect saint, whose very blood was saturated with empathy, selflessness and a ferocious desire to help humanity, would this be an acceptable state of affairs?

We know power corrupts. It's a constant theme in human history. And we know that strong financial incentives are difficult to navigate away from. So how can one human be in charge of such a powerful, amorphous organization that is richer than many countries, and is capable of influencing the very thoughts and emotions experienced by billions of people on a daily basis?

Is that not too much for one human to be in charge of? 

### Do tech companies really know what their users want to do?
In venture-backed tech, startups aim for huge growth and heavy engagement on their products. There are countless anecdotes of companies aggresively building and optimizing features in order to lead to more clicks, more hours of video watched, more tweets written and more messages sent. 

The companies built those features so they want their users to use them. Seems reasonable so far. 

However, I've always found it confusing when people use engagement metrics to explain user satisfaction or user desire. 

<!-- <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The tech industry&#39;s conflation of &quot;want&quot; with &quot;are more likely to click on&quot; is the root of so many of its problems <a href="https://t.co/SghroVMoq8">https://t.co/SghroVMoq8</a></p>&mdash; Olivia Solon (@oliviasolon) <a href="https://twitter.com/oliviasolon/status/1090660259419455488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2019</a></blockquote> -->

I agree with her sentiment.

For example, people watch TV and there are ads on TV. But the fact that people watch TV does not mean that people want ads on TV. People are watching TV in spite of the ads. Sure, there are people who enjoy ads on TV but it seems incomplete to conclude that ads (a feature) are what people want.
 
Have you given users alternatives and seen what they chose? And even if you did that, explaining human behavior is a complicated endeavor that "likes", "comments" and even hours spent using apps fail to explain. Behavioral economists have demonstrated that humans are not rational beings. Understanding why humans do the things that we do is not as that. We frequently do things that are at odds with our wants. 

Also, some user actions occur because of compulsive instincts rather than desire. 

My guess is that for every app, each user has a different curve that explains what their optimal use of that app looks like. Here, I'm optimizing for what's best for the user not the company. 

For some apps, your best return on time investment on an app could be five minutes a month. That is, beyond spending five minutes on that app, your expected utility would be reduced. So if this is true, it makes sense that you shouldn't spend more than five minutes on that app each month. And assuming you're living life to maximize utility, your desire would be to spend five minutes on said app a month. This explains your innate desire not the fact that you mindlessly scrolled over a never-ending timeline for twenty-four minutes. 

Now, obviously I know companies want more engagement so they can sell more ads to sustain their business. I have no issue with that. But call a spade, a spade. If you're selling ads to pad the balance sheets, then say that! There's no need to say you're building something because I (as a user) want it. You want it not me! 

 
### How do we discern truth online in a world where misinformation is rife?
(TODO - in progress) 
There's so much BS online.
(Excuse my French)
In today's hyper-polarized America, people create fake, inauthentic stories, images and videos online for nefarious purposes or financial gain.

Anti-vaccine myth peddlers are partially to blame for the recent Measles outbreak. Remember Measles, the deadly virus that the US eradicated in 2000? Yep, sadly it's back. 

< give example of the Alex Jones and Sandy Hook> 

We're entering a world where there will be an infinite battle between peddlers of misinformation (they will always exist) and the gatekeepers of truth on given platforms. 
But is this what we want? 
How do we ensure the processes of determining truth are in line with the values that the platform users have?
What can every day users do in order to independently verify the truth? 
But then this opens up more questions because we 
I personally have become more even more skeptical about stuff. If it's a scientific fact, I try to see if I can read the papers. Sometimes they make sense to me. Other times, they're so far removed from my expertise that I just try to google around to independently verify the facts.

Okay, those are enough questions for one Sunday afternoon. 
Til' next time ☺️.
