title: the masquerade of choice
date: '2018-12-30'
synopsis: Apps give you the ability to make many small choices every day. But who decides the options you get to choose from? And what drives those decisions?

I would love it if I could ask Pinterest exactly why it thought I was interested in something, and fix those assumptions if they are incorrect.

the above applies to any 

Consumers never see the assumptions. But we see the results. The assumptions, the modelling, the guesses, the judgement, the nuance. All of that is hidden behind a seemingly innocent box, a div, a little square not so much pretending as portending to be nice. "You gave us the punch without the nuance." - potential article title

Let's envision a thought experiment. 

If I got a lab rat, and I carefully exploited its biology (giving it little sugar snacks when it did something I liked; and xyz when it didn't).

Tech is pervasive in our lives today. No shit sherlock. 

Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove

way. On her way she met a copy.

### Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with

they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.

It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.
